"""Reading a user's species list, and finding the relatives they left out.

Two things happen here, and the second is the one that earns the tool its keep.

**Congeners inside the set** drive how the model answers. When several chosen
species share a genus the cascade can fall back to a genus answer that is
technically correct and practically empty -- "it is a Sedum" on a list of six
Sedums -- so a high in-set congener fraction predicts a low species-level share.

**Congeners outside the set** drive how the model fails. A relative that is not
in the catalogue has no correct label available, and the measurements show
near-OOD is where rejection is weakest. Those are the species a user will be
confidently told are something else, and naming them is more useful than any
aggregate.

The reference pool for "what else is in this genus" is the local catalogue.
That is a floor, not a census: it holds 530 labels collapsing to 499 binomials
over 172 genera, so a genus whose relatives it never included will look safer
than it is. Widening it needs only a taxonomy, not images -- but note that at a
pool of thousands this check inverts: nearly every species would have relatives
outside the set, and "shares a genus" stops carrying information. The warning
would need to rank by embedding distance instead.

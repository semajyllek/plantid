"""The model card -- the artifact that makes a built model trustworthy.

The weights are the commodity here; this is not. A tool that lets anyone train a
narrow classifier and says nothing about its failure modes is a machine for
producing confident wrong answers at scale, and plant identification has
consequences that make that worse than usually.

So the card states, in order: what it was built from, what it actually scores on
held-out data, the species-level share alongside coverage (without which a
congener-dense set reads as the best case rather than the worst), which relatives
it will confuse, and what it cannot do.

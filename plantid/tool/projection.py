"""Projecting what a species list will give you, before spending any compute.

`plan` has to answer "what will I get" without fetching images or fitting a head,
so it interpolates the measured grid in `frontier.json` rather than running
anything. Two axes, both of which the measurements show matter:

  K                   catalogue size -- the encoder gap shrinks as K falls
  congener fraction   share of chosen species sharing a genus with another
                      chosen species -- drives the species-level share

The congener anchors are **measured, not assumed**. The "unrelated" arm is not
at 0.0: random draws from a 530-species catalogue over 172 genera collide often
enough to sit at 0.10 (K=10), 0.23 (K=20) and 0.44 (K=50). Interpolating from a
notional 0.0 would make well-separated sets look better than anything measured.

This is a projection from measurements on *a* catalogue, not a guarantee about
the user's. `build` measures the real thing and the card reports that instead.
